/**
 * The staircase repair's own tests, next to the mod's own code. Moved here
 * wholesale from packages/core/src/gen/gen.test.ts when the fix left core: the
 * assertions are unchanged, only their home and their imports are.
 *
 * Four things they establish:
 *
 *  1. The repair works on the shape of the real defect (a stair sealed inside a
 *     vault), picks its replacement grid the way alloc_stairs would, falls back to
 *     the player's own grid, refuses when nothing will hold a stair, and never
 *     mints a way down on a quest floor.
 *  2. It repairs every seed measured stranded under faithful core - the fix half
 *     of the control/fix pair whose control still lives in core.
 *  3. It reaches a real game through startGame's modHooks (the plumbing).
 *  4. THE DETERMINISM RATCHET: a level needing no repair is BIT-IDENTICAL to one
 *     generated with no mod at all, for the same seed.
 *
 * Everything is driven through @rpgm-tools/neo-angband-core's published API, so this also
 * demonstrates that a third-party level mod needs nothing private.
