/**
 * The `bug-fixes` mod's behaviour, as the mod's OWN code.
 *
 * Nothing in this file is compiled into core. Delete this folder and every fix
 * below goes with it - there is no `bugfix.*` string, no staircase repair, no
 * duplicate-artifact guard and no message rewriter anywhere in packages/core.
 * That is the whole point of the mod being a mod (neostryder, 2026-07-29: "the whole
 * point of making them mods was to exclude them from the core game").
 *
 * Each patch cites its upstream issue; docs/modding/BUG_FIXES.md carries the
 * long form (issue / PR / commit per entry).
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------
 * ENTRY POINT CONTRACT - one shape, for every mod and every front end
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * A mod that runs code default-exports a ModPlugin (src/mod-plugin.ts):
 *
 *   export default { api: 1, hooks(ctx) { ... } }
 *
 * `ctx.flags` is the host's RESOLVED per-patch choice map: every `rules[].flag`
 * this mod declares in its manifest.json, mapped to the value the player's toggles
 * settled on (manifest `default` unless they changed it). The host calls `hooks`
 * ONCE per enabled mod, in load order, and folds the results with composeModHooks
 * (core/mod/hooks.ts) into the single ModHooks core holds.
 *
 * `ctx.core` is the ENGINE, handed in, and this file imports @rpgm-tools/neo-angband-core for
 * TYPES ONLY. The same source is built to the `plugin.js` that ships in this mod's
 * own repository, and a module fetched from a folder cannot resolve a bare
 * specifier - nor should it, because a bundled copy of core would give the plugin
 * its own registries while the game ran on another set. src/mod-plugin.ts's header
 * has the full argument. stairs.ts is handed the slice it needs for the same
 * reason.
 *
 * Three rules make this shape work:
 *
 *  1. THE MOD READS ITS OWN FLAGS. Core never sees a flag name. A hook is
 *     installed only if the patch that needs it is on, so a patch the player
 *     switched off is not merely inert - its hook is ABSENT, and core takes the
 *     faithful path with one undefined check.
 *  2. NEVER RETURN A FUNCTION THAT SELF-DISABLES. `historyAdd: (e) => flags.x ?
 *     !e.duplicate : true` would be wrong even though it behaves the same: an
 *     installed hook is a promise to core that something wants that point, and
 *     under composeModHooks a hook that is present but opinionless still runs
 *     (and, for the first-handler hooks, can shadow another mod's).
 *  3. A DISABLED MOD IS NEVER CALLED AT ALL. The host does not invoke this
 *     function for a mod the player has not enabled, so returning `{}` here
 *     means "enabled, but every patch off".
 *
 * The mod uses core's public API - the same API a third-party mod has. It touches
 * no private path and no test hook.
