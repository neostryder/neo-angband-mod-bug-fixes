/**
 * "Misc. string fixes" (bugfix.miscStrings) - cosmetic corrections to the text
 * Angband 4.2.6 itself ships, and the bug-fixes mod's own code. Core keeps
 * upstream's wording EXACTLY; nothing here is compiled into it.
 *
 * WHAT THIS ACTUALLY IS, measured rather than assumed, over the 577 distinct
 * literals reference/src hands to msg / msgt / get_check / get_string /
 * get_quantity. Sentence-break spacing splits like this:
 *
 * | break        | one space | two spaces |
 * | ------------ | --------- | ---------- |
 * | after `.`    | 2         | 15         |
 * | after `!`    | 3         | 0          |
 * | after `?`    | 0         | 0          |
 *
 * So upstream is NOT inconsistent about wanting two spaces - it is consistent
 * about it (15 of 17) and slips twice. The patch therefore normalizes the
 * MINORITY form up to the majority, rather than flattening the majority down:
 * exactly neostryder's rule, that a convention used throughout is not a defect and
 * only the less-frequent variant gets corrected.
 *
 * The three `!` breaks are the judgement call. Pooled across terminators they
 * are minority spellings of one convention and get the same treatment; split by
 * terminator they are 3 of 3 and would be the local majority. Pooling wins here
 * because the convention is "two spaces after a sentence", not "after a period",
 * and because a reader sees one message stream, not three punctuation classes.
 * Dropping the three `!` entries below is the whole change if that reading is
 * wrong.
 *
 * ZERO misspellings, also measured: a pass over the same corpus for the usual
 * suspects (recieve, seperate, occured, acheive, neccessary, definately, teh,
 * loosing) turned up nothing, and so did a separate sweep of the gamedata
 * descriptions - see MISSPELLINGS below.
 *
 * A general rewrite rule was considered and rejected. Messages reach the sink
 * already interpolated, so a blanket ". " -> ".  " would rewrite object
 * inscriptions and character names the player typed. An exact-match table
 * cannot misfire that way, and the measurement says it needs four rows - five
 * single-spaced literals upstream, one of which the port cannot emit.
 *
 * THE LIMIT THE messageText HOOK IMPOSES, and which this patch respects: a hook
 * may only RESTATE a message. Changing what a message MEANS would put text in
 * front of the player that upstream never wrote, and no census could see it,
 * because a paraphrase fills the slot it should have left empty (neostryder,
 * 2026-07-28). Every row below differs from its key by exactly one doubled
 * space, and the mod's test asserts that mechanically.
 */

/**
 * Upstream's own single-spaced sentence breaks, normalized to the double space

 * hand this function the finished message for the lookup to hit.
 *
 * "Non-existent glyph requested. Please report this bug." (ui-prefs.c) is a
 * sixth instance upstream, deliberately absent here: the port has no glyph
 * request path to emit it (text-census KNOWN_ABSENT, internal-error category),
 * so a row for it would be a rule nothing can ever apply.
